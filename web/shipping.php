We ship all domestic orders by UPS, with the exception of partial kits 
and NHRC-VSQs, which we may ship by priority mail.<p>
For orders shipped by UPS, we charge the actual UPS rate, plus $3 for handling.<p>
Please contact the factory for information on COD, next day, international,
or other special shipping requirements.
<p>
<center><b>International Shipping Disclaimer</b></center><p>
Our goal is for our international customers to receive their orders in 
good condition with minimal delay.   We have found that only UPS and Fedex 
offer reliable and traceable shipping, and other shipping methods result in
frustrated and unhappy customers.<p>
For the protection of our customers NHRC ships all Credit Card orders via 
UPS fully insured and traceable door to door.  We will ship via Fedex when
the freight is billed directly to your Fedex account.<p>
At our customers request, we will be happy to offer quotations for other 
shipping methods.  However, we will only ship with other carriers 
<i>at your risk</i> and do require prepayment by money order or wire transfer.
NHRC assumes no risk whatsoever for any order shipped internationally by 
any means other than UPS or Fedex, as described above.
