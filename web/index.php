<p class="subjHead">Our Philosophy about Firmware and Software</p>
<p>You won't be seeing lots of firmware updates for our products.  
Our products are functionally complete and fully tested at the time 
of shipment.  We are not in the Windows software business, either. 
For our products that can be programmed from a Windows PC,
the Windows software is <i>included</i> in the purchase price, and
free for our customer and prospective customers to download from
our web site.  We are a controller company, not a software house.<p>
<p>
We have over 2,500 satisfied customers, and there are <i>thousands</i> of
repeaters worldwide operating with NHRC products.
