Our Repeater Controllers
</div><p>
We believe that our repeater controllers have the best price/performance ratio
in the industry.  Besides good value, there are several good technical reasons
to choose NHRC:
<ul>
<li><b>Electrically quiet design</b>
<blockquote>
Our controllers feature a &quot;bus-less&quot; design.  This dramatically
reduces EMI and the consequent interference problems and noise that can come
with conventional microprocessor-based controllers.
</blockquote>
<li><b>True Speech</b>
<blockquote>
Speech synthesizers sound so <i>eighties</i>.  Many of our repeater
controllers offer true speech that sounds much more natural and
intelligible than old-fashioned speech synthesizers.
</blockquote>
<li><b>Status Display LEDs</b>
<blockquote>
All of our controllers, except the NHRC-2, have status display LEDs that
make controller installation and setup a snap.

    This is our very smallest controller.  It can be used as a conventional
    repeater controller, an IDer, or a beacon controller.  It measures
    2&quot; X 1 1/4&quot;, allowing it to be installed almost anywhere with
    mounting tape.<p>

  <dd>
    After 15 years, we could no longer get the parts for the NHRC-2 any 
    more.  We sold <i>thousands</i> of NHRC-2s, so it was a tough thing
    for us to try to top it.  We think we did with the NHRC-2.1: it's the 
    NHRC-2 with twice the voice storage, plus a real CTCSS input and fan 
    control output.  The NHRC-2.1 continues the tradition of the NHRC-2, 
    an inexpensive repeater controller with 4 stored voice messages.
    Available as a partial kit or assembled and tested.<p>
  <dt><a href="nhrc-3.1/index.php">NHRC-3.1</a>
  <dd>
    We've continued to enhance one of our most popular repeater controllers,
    making it even more powerful and easier to use.
    The NHRC-3.1 has 8 real speech messages you record,
    diagnostic status LEDs, a CTCSS input, multi-tone courtesy
    tones, a fan control output, two digital outputs, two courtesy
    tone select inputs, NHRC's unique audio test feature,
    simpler, more user-friendly DTMF programming,
    and <i>free Windows-based programming software</i>.<br>
    The NHRC-3.1 can control a full-duplex, simplex, or link repeater.<p>
  <dt><a href="nhrc-4/index.php">NHRC-4</a>
  <dd>Our inexpensive linking repeater controller, as seen in the September
    1998 issue of <i>73 Amateur Radio Today</i>.  Available as both a
    partial kit and assembled and tested.<p>
  <dt><a href="/nhrc-5/index.php">NHRC-5</a><br>
  <dd>
    A linking repeater controller with real stored speech, digital I/O,
    an auxiliary audio input, etc.  A highly integrated design,
    with state-of-the-art components, results in a powerful, reliable,
    but still affordable, repeater controller.<p>
  <dt><a href="nhrc-7/index.php">NHRC-7</a>
  <dd>
    The NHRC-7 is a <b>true dual-port</b> bridging repeater controller.  It can be used
    for two duplex repeaters, a duplex repeater with a link radio, or to
    build a <b>bi-directional cross band repeater with simplex radios.</b>
    This allows a variety of unique applications, including inter-system
    radio bridges.  Each port can have it's own ID message, or no ID at
    all, making the NHRC-6 ideal for interoperating with IRLP systems. The
    NHRC-7 includes a dedicated control receiver port,
    digital inputs and outputs, and flexible CTCSS encoder control. <p>
