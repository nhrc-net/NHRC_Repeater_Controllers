The History of NHRC LLC
</div><p>
Founded in 1998, NHRC LLC is a company formed by Rich Cox, N1LTL, Peter 
Gailunas, KA1OKQ, and Jeff Otterson, N1KDO.  Over the years, we tried many 
different controllers for our repeaters, but we never found any that we 
really liked.  We decided that we could build better repeater controllers
than we could buy.
<p>
In 1992, we designed the NHRC-1 repeater controller.  The NHRC-1 had every 
feature we could imagine, so we could implement our dream repeater systems.
The NHRC-1 prototypes we built  worked very well, and we learned a lot from
them. However, the design used about 80 ICs and had far too many pots.  We 
decided it was not practical to continue development of the NHRC-1.  The 
NHRC-1 project was ultimately killed in 1995.
<p>
We talked to our friends who also ran repeaters, and asked them what they 
<i>really needed</i> from a repeater controller.  In the Spring of 1995, 
their input led to the design of the <a href="nhrc-2/">NHRC-2</a>, our 
first commercially successful repeater controller. In many ways, the 
minimalist design of the NHRC-2 repeater controller was a reaction to the
 overkill of the NHRC-1.  Our friends could not believe that we had 
crammed so much functionality into a repeater controller with only four
chips!
<p>
We decided to share our design with more people than our immediate
friends, so we wrote an article about the NHRC-2, which appeared in the 
February 1997 <i>QST</i> magazine.  When we submitted the article, the 
editors at QST suggested we might sell a &quot;few dozen&quot; partial 
kits for the project.  We were shocked and surprised when we received 
over 500 orders in the first month after the article was published!  
Since then, we have sold <i>thousands</i> of NHRC-2 partial kits.  The
NHRC-2 may be the most popular repeater controller ever!
<p>
The amazing and unexpected success of the NHRC-2 led us to believe that 
there might actually be a market for inexpensive repeater controllers,
so, in January 1998, we formed NHRC LLC.
<p>
In the years since the NHRC-2, we have created and sold <i>fifteen</i> 
additional products, all repeater controllers or related equipment.  We 
have sold <i>thousands</i> of repeater controllers to our customers 
worldwide, including amateurs, commercial radio operators, and government
agencies.  All of our controllers continue to provide the same benefits
as the NHRC-2 -- a very usable feature set, with a minimalist electronic
design, resulting in practical and inexpensive products.
<p>
We strive for constant improvement.  There are usually several new NHRC
products under development.  As technology improves, and our users needs
change, we are constantly working to bring our customers effective and
attractively priced repeater controllers and related accessories.
