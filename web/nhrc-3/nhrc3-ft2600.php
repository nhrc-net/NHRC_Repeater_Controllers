Many modern amateur transceivers have a built-in packet radio connector.  In
most cases, this connector has all the signals required to interface a
NHRC-3 repeater controller to form a simplex repeater.<p>
This application note shows how to connect the Yaesu FT-2600 2-meter radio
to the NHRC-3 to form a simplex repeater.  No modifications to the radio or
the controller are needed, this installation is as simple as wiring up a
cable to connect the radio to the controller.<p>
NHRC suggests a careful reading of Part 97 prior to operating a simplex
repeater in the United States.<p>
