<font size=5><b>Announcing the NHRC-2.1 Repeater Controller</b></font><P>
January 31, 2013<p>
The <a href="nhrc-2.1">NHRC-2.1 Repeater Controller</a>
is the latest generation of of NHRC's popular NHRC-2 Repeater Controller.  The NHRC-2
was a wildly successful product for us, possibly one of the most popular repeater
controllers ever designed, as many thousand were purchased.  However, some of the parts
became obsolete after 15 years, so we designed the new NHRC-2.1, which improves on the
NHRC-2 with twice as much stored speech time, a real CTCSS decoder input, and a fan
control output that can be reassigned to be used as a digital control output.<p>
The NHRC-2.1 partial kit is $59, and the assembled and tested controller is $159. 
Both are available for immediate shipment.<p>
