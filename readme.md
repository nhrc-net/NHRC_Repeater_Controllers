## Why this is here?

We (Peter and Jeff) have released this source code and documentation for released 
NHRC products in order to support our customer base after we closed our business 
in March 2021.  The code is here in order that our customers may correct defects
or software bugs in their existing NHRC products.

We did not release this code to allow people to clone our projects.  We made a 
significant investment in hardware and software development.  If you want to build new
devices with this code, please contact us to arrange (affordable) licensing.  You
are NOT authorized to build new hardware using this source code.
