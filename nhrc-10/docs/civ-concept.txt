NHRC-10 CI-V EEPROM Read/Write Protocol
2003.12.16

NHRC-10 CI-V address is E0
PC Program CI-V address is E1

Commands:

77 NHRC private command

Subcommands:

00 Read EEPROM
01 Write EEPROM

Payload data is in nibbles, rather than bytes, to eliminate clashing with CI-V 
command bytes, which are in the FA-FE range.

Read Bytes from EEPROM command:

  Computer sends to controller

    FE FE E0 E1 77 00 a1 a2 a3 a4 ll c1 c2 FD

  Where
    FE FE is CI-V preamble
    E0 is the destination CI-V address
    E1 is the source CI-V address
    77 is the NHRC private command
    00 is the read EEPROM command
    a1 a2 a3 a4 are the EEPROM address.  
      a1 is the hi nibble of the hi byte
      a2 is the lo nibble of the hi bite
      a3 is the hi nibble of the lo byte
      a4 is the lo nibble of the lo byte
    ll is the number of bytes to transfer, 1 to 8.
    c1 c2 are the checksum
      c1 is the hi nibble of the checksum byte
      c2 is the lo nibble of the checksum byte

  Controller responds with 

    FE FE E1 E0 77 01 a1 a2 a3 a4 ll dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl c1 c2 FD

  Where 
    dh dl are the data bytes.
      dh is the hi nibble of the data byte
      dl is the lo nibble of the data byte

  NO MORE THAN 8 BYTES MAY BE TRANSFERRED IN A SINGLE EXCHANGE.

  Alternately, the controller may return the NAK message:

  FE FE E1 E0 FA FD

Write Bytes to EEPROM command:

  Computer sends to controller

    FE FE E0 E1 77 01 a1 a2 a3 a4 ll dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl dh dl c1 c2 FD

  Controller responds with

    FE FE E1 E0 FB FD  -- acknowlege.  success.
      or
    FE FE E1 E0 FA FD  -- failure.
